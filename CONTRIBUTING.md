## **📑 Code of Conduct**
For everything in the project, the [Code of Conduct] applies.

Help us to keep our projects open and inclusive.


## **❓ Questions & Answers**
Do not use the [issue tracker](#-issue-tracker) for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.

Instead, we recommend using our [Discord server][Discord] to ask support-related questions.

To save your and our time, we will close all issues that are requests for general support without further feedback.


## **🐞 Issue Tracker**
The issue tracker is the preferred method to report bugs and request features.

It serves two purposes:
1. structuring the contributions into logical aspects
2. keeping the community involved in what's going on

Please respect the following restrictions:
1. Do not use the issue tracker for personal support requests! This can be done on our [Discord].
2. Follow the respective issue templates and fill in the details as best as you can.
3. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinion of others.
4. Avoid posting multiple issues about the same topic.
5. Keep yourself up to date and check if you have the newest version and if your bug report or feature request was already processed.

To save your and our time, anything that doesn't follow our guidelines will be closed without further feedback.


## **🧠 Pull Requests**
Pull requests are a good method to contribute to the project.

If you consider opening a pull request, thanks a lot. We appreciate the effort and try our best to process it.

The pull request should follow the respective pull request template. The logical steps to contribute to a project are:
1. [Fork][forking] the project.
2. [Create a new branch][create branch] with a descriptive and short name off the main project branch.
3. Apply your changes.
4. Make sure you also update the documentation accordingly.
5. Push the code to your own branch.
6. [Open a pull request][pull request] with a clear title and description.

**Important:**<br>
By creating a pull request, you agree to license your work under the same license as that used by the project.


## **💘 Thank you**
We are grateful for any contribution to our projects.

Stay awesome!
